## Why This Topic is Important

When working in data analytics, especially in a team,
keeping track of every change made to a project is crucial.
You need a way to track who made what changes and when.
Also, if something goes wrong, you need the ability to revert to an earlier
version of your work.
We need a system that will track versions for us - a version control system.

## Introduction

Git is a version control system used by millions of developers and analysts to manage and track changes in their projects.
It saves versions of your work and maintains a complete history of the project.

Version control keeps a detailed history of your project.
Every change you make in your files is tracked by Git, allowing you to see what was changed, when, and by whom.

With Git, you have a local repository on your computer and a remote repository for sharing and collaborating with others, which can be hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

A commit in Git is like saving your progress with a detailed note.
It records the current state of your project, along with a message explaining what was changed.

After committing changes with a message, we typically push the commits to GitHub.
