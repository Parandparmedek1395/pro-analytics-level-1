## Why This Topic is Important

Understanding how Python is organized is a key to successful projects and reusable, maintainable code.
AI assistants can help implement specific tasks, but the design and architecture of the overall project is an important and human-level task.  
Understanding how Python is organized is important for using Python effectively - as well as making unique contributions.

## Introduction

Modules in Python are just Python files with a `.py` extension containing Python definitions and statements.
They help break down large programs into manageable and organized files.
Packages are groups of related modules organized by folders.
Packages allow for a hierarchical structuring of the module namespace using dot notation.
Libraries are collections of packages and modules that extend the functionality of Python.

## Skill Summary

- **Creating Modules**
  - Creating a Python file with function definitions
  - Using modules by importing them
- **Using Packages**
  - Multiple Python files into a package
  - Using the Standard Library
- **Importing Modules and Packages**
  - Using `import` statements
  - Importing specific functions, classes, or attributes
- **Script vs. Module**
  - A script is a Python file we execute.
  - A module is a Python file we import.
  - Many Python files are both.
  - When importing, we don't want to execute anything, so we add `if __name__ == "__main__":`
  - The dunders (double underscores) indicate built-in variables in Python.
  - You should be comfortable using this code block (your AI will write it for you).
- **Best Practices**
  - Organizing code logically into modules and packages
  - Documenting modules and functions for better readability and maintainability
