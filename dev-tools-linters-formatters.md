## Why This Topic is Important

Writing high-quality code is hard. We use a variety of tools and AI assistants to help.
Formatters will automatically format our code to a standard.
Linters go further and will actually re-write code to fix common "code smells".
Adding formatters and linters to your workflow helps make your projects professional from the start.

## Introduction

Each organization will have standards for their code. People have written software programs to help us format and write code according to company standards.
On your own, they are optional, but will likely be required at work.
Being comfortable with these can help you be more productive and professional.

## Key Development Tools

### Formatters

- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that supports multiple languages. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and reprinting it with its own rules, ensuring uniformity across your project.

### Linters

- **Ruff**: A fast, Python-specific linter written in Rust. It checks your Python code for stylistic errors, bugs, and deviations from best practices.
- **Mypy**: A static type checker for Python. It helps catch type-related errors in Python code, making your applications less prone to runtime errors.
- **pytype**: Google's static type analyzer for Python.

## Recommendations

1. Configure these tools to run automatically in your IDE or code editor.
1. Keep them updated.
1. Use them consistently.
1. Use the defaults and explore customizations as needed.
1. Be flexible. Your team may have specific standards already in use.
