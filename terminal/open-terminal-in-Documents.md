# Open a Terminal in Your Documents Folder

Every analyst should know some basic terminal commands and how to create a project folder. 
These skills lay the foundation for file system navigation and manipulation.

We'll use the terminal to enter commands. 
Terminal commands are fast and reliableâ€”they are often favored over graphical environments once you start spending more time on your computer.

## On Windows (Using PowerShell)

1. Open PowerShell
   - Click on the Start menu and type PowerShell.
   - Click on Windows PowerShell to open it.

2. Navigate to the Documents Folder
   - By default, PowerShell opens in your user directory (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName`).
   - To navigate to your Documents folder, type the following command and press Enter.
     ```powershell
     cd Documents
     ```
   - You should now be in your Documents folder. The terminal prompt should show something like `C:\Users\YourName\Documents>`.

## On Mac/Linux (Using the Default Terminal)

1. Open Terminal
   - On Mac, open Finder, go to Applications, then Utilities, and double-click on Terminal.
   - On Linux, you can usually find the terminal in your applications menu, or you can press `Ctrl + Alt + T` to open it.

2. Navigate to the Documents Folder
   - When you open the terminal, it usually starts in your home directory (e.g., `/Users/YourName` on Mac or `/home/YourName` on Linux).
   - To navigate to your Documents folder, type the following command and press Enter.
     ```bash
     cd Documents
     ```
   - You should now be in your Documents folder. The terminal prompt should show something like `/Users/YourName/Documents` on Mac or `/home/YourName/Documents` on Linux.
