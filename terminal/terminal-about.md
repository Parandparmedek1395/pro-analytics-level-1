## Why This Topic is Important

The terminal, also known as the command line interface (CLI),
is a powerful tool for interacting with your computer.
It allows you to execute commands by typing text and is essential for programming,
especially in environments like Python.
Understanding the terminal is key to efficiently navigating directories,
executing scripts, and using advanced tools and technologies.
Being skilled with terminals can super-charge your productivity.

## Introduction

For many beginners, the terminal can seem daunting with its text-only interface.
However, it's a fundamental skill in programming and system navigation.
Mastering the terminal will empower you to perform a wide range of tasks more efficiently.

## Types of Terminals

Depending on your operating system, you'll have different terminal options.

### Windows Recommended

On Windows, there are four terminals you'll likely use quite a bit.

- **PowerShell Core (pwsh)**: A cross-platform version of PowerShell that can be installed on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Version 7 and higher. Windows users should use this or Windows PowerShell (works much the same, just a bit older).
- **Windows PowerShell (powershell)**: A command line tool built into Windows. Version 5 and higher. Windows users should use this or PowerShell Core.
- **Git Bash (bash)**: A terminal emulator for Git that provides a Linux-like terminal environment.
- **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**: Provides a Linux-like terminal environment for advanced users.

### Windows Older Option

- Command Prompt (cmd): Older, native Windows command line interface.
- Deprecated in favor of PowerShell.
- Important: Commands intended for the command prompt may not work in PowerShell.
- Use correct commands for your terminal.

### MacOS/Linux Recommended

- **Terminal**: The default CLI provided in MacOS and Linux distributions. This is the recommended default terminal for MacOS and Linux users.
- **PowerShell Core (pwsh)**: A cross-platform version of PowerShell that can be installed on MacOS and Linux. Also highly recommended and growing in popularity. Excellent for analytics related to system administration and security. Consider adding this option.
