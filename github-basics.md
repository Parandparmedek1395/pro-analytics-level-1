# GitHub Basics - Storing and Sharing Projects

[Professional Analytics](https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics)

## Why This Topic is Important

Typically as analysts we work on a team.
A team needs a place to store the project that everyone can access.
It also needs to be safe from the outside.
We want to track all changes by user and datetime so we can trace the
 evolution of the project and revert back to an older version as needed.

## Introduction

GitHub is used by over 65 million developers to store and share code projects.
Becoming part of this community and learning to use Git are key skills
 that can make us easier to onboard and more productive on the job.

You'll need an **email**.
I use a permanent personal email for most GitHub work,
 rather than a work or school account (which may be temporary).
Your email will not be made public.

You'll create a GitHub **username**.
Your username will be public.
Your username can be anonymous (e.g., 'analystextraordinaire') or
 publicly associated with you.
 For example, I use 'denisecase'.
 Your username is part of the URL (web address) to all your GitHub projects.

## Project Repository

Each project lives in a GitHub repository (called 'repo' for short)
  in the 'cloud' (a distributed group of machines).
  
With GitHub, developers can create a repository,
a folder or location that contains their code, documentation,
and other files related to a specific project.

## Keeping GitHub Repo in Sync With Local Project Repo

Git (the system) keeps track of committed changes to an evolving project.
A GitHub repo can be kept in sync with a git repo on your local machine.
For example:

- If a GitHub repo is named **datafun-01-getting-started**.
- On my machine, it's in my **Documents/datafun-01-getting-started** folder.

## Forking a Repository

Developers can fork (copy) a repo from a different account to create their own copy of the repo.
This makes it easy to modify the repo and contribute back to the original project repo.
This workflow enables easy collaboration and code sharing among developers.

## GitHub Development Environment

GitHub has a built-in development environment called GitHub Codespaces.
You can use an editor similar to VS Code, except it's all in the cloud,
 using your browser.
You can get started and make changes to a project quickly and easily.

To enter the development environment, click the green Code button
 and select "Open with Codespaces".

## Recruiters and GitHub

Recruiters may look at GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.
It can be helpful to show your skills using modern tools.
Be courageous.
The best way to learn is by doing,
 and don't be too concerned about making mistakes.
Git mistakes and do-overs are common getting started.
Learning to fix issues is a key skill in data analytics.
Keep and share your latest, most useful, and best work in GitHub.
Ensure each repository has a meaningful README to explain the project's
 purpose, setup, and usage.

## Public vs. Private Repositories

At work, companies might keep projects private and might use GitLab or BitBucket
 to store projects.
 Most modern companies use something similar to perform this role.
Open-source projects are often stored on GitHub and can be worked on by anyone.
Getting familiar with GitHub is a great way to get started with
 professional projects for data analytics.

## GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an AI assistant to help write code.

## Free Stuff for Students

Students can get access to GitHub Copilot and more
 with the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

## GitHub CLI (Terminal Commands)

Recommended: Work fast with the official GitHub CLI (command-line interface), gh. 
Install it from [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com/).
