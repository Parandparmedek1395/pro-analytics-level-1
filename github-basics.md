[Professional Analytics](https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics)

## Why This Topic is Important

Typically as analysts we work on a team.
A team needs a place to store the project that everyone can access.
It also needs to be safe from the outside.
We want to track all the changes by user and datetime so we can trace the evolution of the project and revert back to an older version if needed.

## Introduction

GitHub is used by over 65 million developers to store and share code projects of all kinds.
Becoming part of this community and learning to use Git are key skills that can make you easier to onboard and more productive on the job.

## Repositories

A repository is a place to store a project.

## Public vs. Private Repositories

At work, they might keep things private - might use GitLab or BitBucket to store projects privately. Most modern companies use something quite similar to perform this role.
Open-source projects are often stored on GitHub and can be worked on by anyone.
Getting familiar with GitHub is a great way to get started with professional projects for data analytics.

## GitHub Development Environment

GitHub has a built-in development environment called GitHub Codespaces.
You can use an editor similar to VS Code, except it's all in the cloud - accessible via your browser.
You can get started and make changes to a project quickly and easily.

To enter the development environment, click the green Code button and select Open with Codespaces.
