## Why This Topic is Important

Pandas and Numpy are two of the most popular libraries for data analytics in Python.

## Introduction

Pandas enables working with data in a tabular format, similar to a spreadsheet.
Numpy provides support for working with arrays and matrices.
Pandas is built on Numpy, and they are often used together.

## Skills

- **Pandas**

  - **DataFrames**: A two-dimensional tabular data structure with labeled axes.
  - **Series**: A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.
  - **Read Data**: Read data from CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, and more.
  - **Write Data**: Write data to CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, and more.
  - **Data Manipulation**: Select, filter, sort, group, aggregate, and more.
  - **Data Visualization**: Create plots and charts from data.
