# Executing Python

[Professional Analytics](https://github.com/denisecase/pro-analytics)

## Why This Topic is Important

Python code doesn't do anything unless you execute it.
Executing also called running your code can be done in several ways.
You can execute a statement at a time in interactive mode,
or you can code up a bunch of Python, save it in a file, and execute the file all at once.

Many people are used to graphical user interfaces (GUIs) where you point and click to do things.
We'll run our Python in a terminal window, which is a text-based interface.
It may involve several new concepts and tools, but it's a great way to work with Python.

## Introduction

We'll execute Python code interactively and in scripts.

Interactive mode

On your machine, just open a terminal window and type `python` to get started.
On Windows, try py instead of python.
On Mac and Linux, try python3 instead of python.

Start online by going to python / try python.org.

Script mode

We'll use a text editor to create a file with Python code, and then execute the file.
If our file is named `hello.py`, we can execute it by typing `python hello.py` in the terminal window.
Remember to use the correct command py or python3, depending on your operating system.

## Skill Summary

  - Using interactive Python (REPL) for quick testing
- **Executing Scripts**
  - Running Python scripts from the command line
  - Understanding script execution process
- **Command Line Arguments**
  - Passing arguments to scripts from the command line
  - Utilizing `sys.argv` in Python for command line inputs
- **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**

## How to Execute a Script

1. **Using the Command Line**:

   - Navigate to the script's directory.
   - Run the script using `python script_name.py`.

2. **Using an IDE**:

   - Open the script in an IDE.
   - Use the IDEâ€™s run functionality to execute the script.

3. **Interactive Python**:
   - Run Python in interactive mode by simply typing `python` in the command line.
   - Test individual lines of code or small code snippets.
